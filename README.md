# Diabetes Prediction with Pima Indians Dataset

This project analyzes and predicts diabetes risk using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. It utilizes machine learning techniques to build predictive models and visualize important health indicators.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curves)
- Visualizations of key features and model performance
- Easy-to-follow Jupyter notebooks and scripts

## Dataset

The Pima Indians Diabetes Database contains several medical predictor variables and one target variable, "Outcome." All patients are females of at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (1: diabetes, 0: no diabetes)

## Getting Started
